This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to the `removeIf` function in Kotlin collections.  The `removeIf` function behaves differently depending on the collection type (List, Set, Map), which can be unexpected.  The `Bug.kt` file showcases this behavior, while `BugSolution.kt` provides a possible workaround to ensure consistent behavior.
